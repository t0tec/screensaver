# Screensaver application
This app is just a screensaver that generates random shapes (circles, rectangles, hexagons).

## Recent edition:

- Added an example to use strategy pattern for drawing shapes in different forms (circles, rectangles, hexagons)
- Instead of using inheritance (extending from Shape) I made different draw strategies (CircleDraw, HexagonDraw, RectangleDraw)
- Now you have more freedom to add new behaviours with ease.

Note: Maybe not the best example to demonstrate the Strategy pattern.
